            <h2>Goal</h2>

            <p>This is deck-building game. The deck is your Dominion. It contains your resources,
                victory points, and the things you can do.</p>

            <p>It starts out a small sad collection of Estates and Coppers,
                but you hope by the end of the game it will be brimming with Gold, Provinces, and the inhabitants
                and structures of your castle and kingdom.
                The player with the most victory points in his Deck at game end wins</p>

            <h2>Preparation</h2>

            <span><h3>There are 5 different kind of cards:</h3></span>

            <h3>Treasure cards</h3>

            <p>There are 3 kinds of Treasure cards:</p>
            <img src="images/gold.jpg" alt="Treasure Card" id="treasurecard">


            <ul>
                <li>Copper</li>
                <li>Silver</li>
                <li>Gold</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are the basic Treasure cards and they are
                available in every game.</p>

            <div id="victory">
            <h3>Victory Cards</h3>
            <img src="images/duchy.jpg" alt="Victory Card" id="victorycard">

            <p>There are 3 kinds of Victory cards: Estate, Duchy and Province cards. These are the basic Victory cards
                and
                they are available in every game.</p>
                <p>Victory cards are very important. When the game ends the amount of Victory Points are counted and the player with the most points is the victor.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Curse Cards</h3>
            <img src="images/curse.jpg" alt="Curse Card" id="cursecard">
            <p>Curse cards are present in every game, however, they are rarely used in the basic game other than with
                the
                Witch card.</p>

            <h3>Trash Cards</h3>
            <img src="images/trashcard.jpg" alt="Trash Card" id="trashcard">
            <p>Trash cards are cards that the player has trashed, meaning the cards are no longer available to use in
                the
                game.</p>
            <p>To trash a card, the player must put the card on the Trash pile (indicated by the Trash Card).</p>

            <h3>Kingdom Cards</h3>

            <p>In addition to the Trash, Treasure, Victory and Curse cards that are used in every game, the players also
                select 10 kingdom cards.</p>

            <p>Kingdom cards are essentially just Action Cards that the players selects at the start of the game so that both players are able to purchase these Action Cards using Treasure Cards.</p>

            <p>For the first game we recommend using the following 10 Kingdom cards: Cellar, Market, Militia, Mine,
                Moat,
                Remodel, Smithy, Village, Woodcutter and Workshop</p>

            <h2>Playing the Game</h2>

            <h3>Turn Overview</h3>

            <p>Each turn has three phases (A, B and C).
            <ul id="phases">
                <li>Action phase: the player may play an Action.</li>
                <li>Buy phase: the player may buy a card.</li>
                <li>Clean-up phase: the player must discard both played and unplayed cards and draws five new cards.
                </li>
            </ul>
            After a player completes all three phases, his/her turn ends.
            </p>

            <h3>Action Phase</h3>

            <p>The player may play one action card if he has one. This is optional, even if the player has an action
                card,
                he need not play it. Action cards will allow players to do extra things during their turns</p>

            <p>As some action cards offer a player additional actions, a player may be able and choose to play several
                action cards in a turn. The player will discard these cards in the clean-up phase. The Action phase ends
                when the player cannot or chooses not to play any more Action cards.</p>

            <h3>Buy phase</h3>

            <p>The player can gain one card from the Supply by buying it - paying the cost shown on the card. The player
                pays in coins from Treasure cards and from previously paid Action cards.</p>

            <p>The player may use any combination of Treasure cards from his/her hand and coins shown on Action cards
                played
                this turn.</p>

            <p>Any Treasure cards played can be placed, adding them to any cards previously played this turn.</p>

            <p>All these cards will be discarded at the end of the turn, and should not be discarded prior to the
                Clean-up
                phase.</p>

            <h3>Clean-up phase</h3>

            <p>The player places all cards onto his/her Discard pile. This will include all Action cards and Treasure
                cards
                he played during this turn. All cards left in the player's hand will also be placed onto the Discard
                pile.</p>

            <p>5 Cards are then drawn from the Deck and the turn ends.</p>

        </article>

        <article>
            <h2>Game End</h2>

            <p>The game ends at the end of any player's turn when either:
            <ol>
                <li>The Supply pile of Province cards is empty</li>
                <li>Any 3 Supply piles are empty</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p>The player with the most Victory points wins, ties go to the player with the fewest turns. If both
                players
                have the same amount of Victory points and the same amount of turns played then both players win.</p>

        <h1>Brief history</h1>

        <article>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Dominion is a deck-building game created by Donald X. Vaccarino and published by Rio Grande Games.
                Players use their cards to perform actions and buy cards from a common pool of card stacks, including Action, Treasure, and Victory cards.
                The player with the most victory points wins. The game has a medieval theme.</p>

            <p>The game was released at Spiel 2008 in multiple languages and voted best game of the fair by the Fairplay polls with a rating of 1.75 from 147 votes.
                In 2009, it won the prestigious Spiel des Jahres and Deutscher Spiele Preis awards.
                It was one of five winning games in American Mensa's 2009 MindGame competition.
                By the end of 2010, more than one million copies of it and its expansions had been sold worldwide.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Vaccarino was a video game programmer and developer in San Francisco in the 1980s and 1990s.
                He spent time playing new German-style board games, prior to the release of Magic: The Gathering in 1993.
                His interest in Magic sparked his own development of a 90-card fan-made extension for the game, Edge of the World, and he became an informal contributor towards additional Magic works.
                He is credited in the official Magic rulebook. He developed several game ideas in the intervening years and discussed them with Magic's creator, Richard Garfield.</p>

            <p>In 2006, Vaccarino invented the deck-building mechanic while working on a fantasy adventure card game called "Spirit Warriors II".
                He struggled with the mechanics of the game before a deadline of showing the game to his local gaming group, and spent one weekend to strip down the game to its core elements;
                specifically, having problems with the concept of introducing cards that could be acquired over time,
                Vaccarino instead opted to simply have all such cards available at the start of the game. Vaccarino introduced the game to his local gaming group at a gaming store;
                the game immediately became popular, overshadowing the usual staples including Magic over the next two years.</p>

            <p>With the success of the game with his local group, Vaccarino began looking to refine and publish the game.
                During the 2007 Origins Game Fair, Vaccarino demonstrated the game and gained the interest of Rio Grande Games.
                Shortly after being signed on with Rio Grande, BoardGameGeek's columnists Valerie Putman and Dale Yu requested Rio Grande to allow them to develop the game.</p>

            <h2>Expansions</h2>
            <p> Vaccarino had planned early on for the game to grow through expansions, though focused these on maintaining the core functionality
                of the game instead of immediately adding "exotic things"; this was to ensure that, if the game did take off, early expansions would not create two disparate sets of cards,
                one focused on the normal Dominion play, and a second with a strange new mechanic.
                In a post to BoardGameGeek, Vaccarino suggested that he had originally planned seven different expansions from the start,
                and in fact, in tuning the core game for release, took cards originally planned for later expansions into the base game.</p>

            <p>There are currently 10 expansions that extend the base game:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Intrigue (July 2009)</li>
                <li>Seaside (October 2009</li>
                <li>Alchemy (May 2010)</li>
                <li>Prosperity (October 2010)</li>
                <li>Cornucopia (June 2011)</li>
                <li>Hinterlands (October 2011)</li>
                <li>Dark Ages (August 2012)</li>
                <li>Guilds (June 2013)</li>
                <li>Adventures (April 2015)</li>
                <li>Empires (2016)</li>
            </ul>
            <p> In June 2012 a set of all the basic cards (Treasures, Victory, and Curse cards) from the standalones and expansions with new design and different art.</p>
